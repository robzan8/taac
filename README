# A command-line interface to the graphhopper route-optimization api

installation:
go get github.com/robzan8/hop

usage:
hop [-geocode] vehicles.csv services.csv your-graphhopper-api-key

When running with flag -geocode, the program adds the latitude and longitude columns to the input csvs
(see the example files in the "data" folder).

Without the flag -geocode, the program takes already geocoded inputs and produces solution.json,
as returned by graphhopper.

The header in the csv files is mandatory and the order of the columns is significant
(not to be changed).
The only vehicle type available is "cargo-bike", with capacity 10.
